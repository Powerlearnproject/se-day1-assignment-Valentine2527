#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering: is a systematic process of coming up with a high quality software systems.
Involving;
•Design.
•Development.
•Testing.
•Deployment.
•Maintenance.
The main Importance in the technology industry:
•To develop reliable, scalable and secure software systems
•Enables the software to meet user requirements.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
•Early Days (1950s - 1960s): The Dawn of Software Engineering
-Software engineering emerged to tackle the challenges of complex software development. and The term "software engineering" was formally introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968.
•Advancement (1970s - 1980s): Embracing Structured Programming and Methodologies.
-Structured programming techniques like top-down design and modular programming gained traction. and Methodologies such as Waterfall and Agile were adopted to streamline software development processes.
•Modern Era (1990s - Present): The Era of Open Source and DevOps.
-Open-source software revolutionized collaboration and code sharing among developers. and DevOps practices integrated development and operations, enhancing software delivery efficiency and quality.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
•Waterfall Methodology:-Sequential approach with distinct phases (requirements, design, implementation, testing, maintenance). 
while; 
Agile Methodology:-Iterative and flexible approach, focusing on adaptive planning and incremental development.

•Waterfall Methodology:-Best suited for projects with well-defined requirements from the start, like constructing a building.
while;
Agile Methodology:-Ideal for projects with evolving requirements, such as software development, allowing for continuous feedback and adjustments.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
•Software Developer:Designs and develops software solutions based on project requirements.

•Quality Assurance Engineer:Tests software to identify defects and ensure high quality.

•Project Manager:Plans, organizes, and oversees the software development project.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
•Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):-Streamline software development by providing tools for coding, debugging, and testing in one interface. By enhancing productivity and collaboration among developers.
Example: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA.
•Version Control Systems (VCS):-Track changes in code, manage different versions, and facilitate team collaboration. Thus Ensuringcode integrity, enable rollback to previous versions, and support parallel development.
Example: Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
•Common Challenges Faced by Software Engineers:-Balancing project deadlines with maintaining code quality.
-Managing complex requirements and changing project scopes.
-Dealing with technical debt and legacy systems.

•Strategies to Overcome These Challenges:-Prioritize tasks effectively and communicate with the team to set realistic timelines.
-Break down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks and adapt to evolving requirements.
-Regularly refactor code to reduce technical debt and gradually modernize legacy systems.
    
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
•Unit Testing:-Testing individual components or modules in isolation to ensure each unit functions correctly on its own.
•Integration Testing:-Testing the interaction between integrated components to verify that combined units work together as expected.
•System Testing:-Testing the entire system as a whole so as to validate the system meets specified requirements.
•Acceptance Testing:-Testing to confirm the system meets user requirements so as to validate the system is ready for deployment and use.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering: The process of contextualizing the questions(prompts) to ask AI models so as to fully utilise they can do and make the best out of it inorder to get what we need from our query.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: What is Mathematics?

Specific Prompt: Being a teacher a nursery school, Define Mathematics in such a way that nursery students can fully understand it using fun examples to elaborate.

It is more effective due to that the first one was going to give me an answer that most likely nursery students would have not understood while I was probably a nursery school teacher in need for the them to simply grasp a simple undeof mathematics but in a fun way so as to make sure they attention spans don't drift away.
